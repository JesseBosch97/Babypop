# Bugs
When trying to connect to a samd board the application will show no communication. 
To fix this, first connect a different terminal like tera term or arduino ide terminal to the samd. 
Verify that communication is indeed happening. Then close the terminal and restart the feedback application. 
Connect to the serial port of the samd device and now the communication should work.
